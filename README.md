Implementation of Google's TensorFlow library for Cigar image recognition. Will be loosly based on the code used to solve the MNIST excercise. Hand-gathered training data will be used.

Initial Neural Net will be a simple NN with no convolution or pooling. After this NN is working, convolution and pooling layers will be added.

Dependencies:
+ NumPy
+ MatPlotLib
+ TensorFlow
+ PIL
